			<div class="box">
				<p class="about-title1">Exmouth View Hotel began as a humble family guesthouse in the early 1990s, built on a piece of cherished land lovingly passed down through generations. Nestled along the stunning coastline, it first served as a quiet retreat for weary travelers and locals in search of a peaceful weekend escape. Surrounded by nature’s serenity and the gentle rhythm of the sea, the guesthouse quickly earned a reputation for its warm, welcoming atmosphere and breathtaking panoramic views of the ocean.

                What began as a small, heartfelt venture soon evolved into a lifelong passion for the family. Their commitment to genuine hospitality, attention to detail, and personal touch became the hallmark of every guest experience. With each passing year, the bond between the family, the land, and the guests grew stronger, turning first-time visitors into returning friends.

                In 2015, driven by a vision to create something truly special, Exmouth View underwent a complete transformation. The property was thoughtfully renovated to combine modern elegance with its original charm. Stylish, airy rooms were introduced, new facilities were added — including a cozy lounge, a coastal-view dining area, and beautifully landscaped gardens — all while preserving the hotel’s intimate connection with nature and its heritage.

                Today, Exmouth View Hotel proudly welcomes guests from all over the world. Whether you're here for a romantic seaside getaway, a family vacation, or a solo retreat to reconnect with yourself, our doors are always open. More than just a place to stay, we offer a home by the sea — where the morning sun paints the sky in golden hues, and the evenings invite quiet reflection under starlit skies. Every stay is crafted with care, every moment steeped in comfort, and every visit becomes a cherished memory waiting to unfold.</p>
